# Store Sales
This is my capstone project for the LaGuardia Data Analytics Python course, DATA201: an analysis of a synthetic dataset created to practice analyzing customer purchasing patterns and preferences.

I originally intended to analyze a business' employee data, as I work in Human Resources myself. But I could not find a dataset that met the project criteria (20,000+ rows of data) so I chose to look at customer trends. In the future I hope to lend my knowledge to small businesses or companies so I felt it was appropriate to give it a try.
